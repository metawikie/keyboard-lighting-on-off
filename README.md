Laptop keyboard lighting has changed the computing game and has made space for nighttime users to power on through the darkness. The vast majority of modern laptop computers come with backlit keyboards in addition to boasting a number of other fancy features that may distract from this rather basic, but wholly necessary feature.
So, you’ve got a new computer and you’re not quite used to the many shortcuts that allow you to change certain settings with the simple click of a button. When the sun goes down and you’ve still got hours of work to go, you’ll want to know how to turn on keyboard lighting so you can soldier on through the night.


## How to turn on a backlit keyboard?

* If your HP notebook computer has a backlit keyboard, take a look at the top bar of your keyboard and locate the F5 button. This button may even be labeled with a backlight icon. Simply clicking this button while pressing the Fn button located at the bottom row of your keyboard will leave you with keyboard lighting operational magic.
* It may be a simple on/off or, on some models, you can adjust the brightness of the backlighting.
* Also, depending on your computer model, your PC may be configured to control the backlit keyboard via the F9 or F11 button rather than the F5 button. Practice the same simultaneous Fn + F11 operation to turn on a backlight keyboard light.

## How to turn off a backlit keyboard?

* Once morning hits and the natural sunshine illuminates your keyboard, you may find you have no need for the keyboard light to be on. In order to turn off the backlight on your laptop keyboard, press the same corresponding keys that allowed you to turn them on.
* This could be a simple F5, F9, or F11 key press, or a dual-action Fn + F5, F9, or F11 key press.
